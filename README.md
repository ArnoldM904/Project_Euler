<h3>Problem descriptions:</h3>


<strong>Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5</strong>
<BR>
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
<BR>

<strong>Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers</strong>
<BR>
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
<BR>

<strong>Problem 3: Largest Prime factor</strong>
<BR>
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
<BR>

<strong>Problem 4: Largest palindrome product</strong>
<BR>
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
<BR>

<strong>Problem 5: Smallest multiple</strong>
<BR>
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
<BR>

<strong>Problem 6: Sum square difference</strong>
<BR>
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
<BR>

<strong>Problem 7: 10001st prime</strong>
<BR>
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10 001st prime number?
<BR>

<strong>Problem 13: Large sum</strong>
<BR>
Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.
[number]
<BR>

<strong>Problem 20: Factorial digit sum</strong>
<BR>
n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1
For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.
Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!
<BR>

<strong>Problem 25: 1000-digit Fibonacci number</strong>
<BR>
Find the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits.
<BR>

<strong>Problem 31: coin sums</strong>
<BR>
In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:
    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
    1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
<BR>

<strong>Problem 48: Self Powers</strong>
<BR>
The series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 10^10 = 10405071317.
Find the last ten digits of the series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 1000^1000.
<BR>

<strong>Problem 56: Powerful digit sum</strong>
<BR>
Find the greatest sum of the digits within A^B where A and B can be any natural number under 100.
<BR>

<strong>Problem 145: How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?</strong>
<BR>
Some positive integers n have the property that the sum [ n + reverse(n) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers reversible; so 36, 63, 409, and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either n or reverse(n).

How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (10^9)?
