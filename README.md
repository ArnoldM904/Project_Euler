<h3>Problem descriptions:</h3>


<strong>Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5</strong>
<BR>
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

<strong>Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers</strong>
<BR>
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

<strong>Problem 3: Largest Prime factor</strong>
<BR>
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

<strong>Problem 4: Largest palindrome product</strong>
<BR>
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

<strong>Problem 5: Smallest multiple</strong>
<BR>
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

<strong>Problem 6: Sum square difference</strong>
<BR>
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

<strong>Problem 7: 10001st prime</strong>
<BR>
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10 001st prime number?

<strong>Problem 20: Factorial digit sum</strong>
<BR>
n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1
For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.
Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

<strong>Problem 25: 1000-digit Fibonacci number</strong>
<BR>
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
    Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:

    F1 = 1
    F2 = 1
    F3 = 2
    F4 = 3
    F5 = 5
    F6 = 8
    F7 = 13
    F8 = 21
    F9 = 34
    F10 = 55
    F11 = 89
    F12 = 144

The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

<strong>Problem 31: coin sums</strong>
<BR>
In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:
    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
    1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

<strong> Problem 48: Self Powers </strong>
<BR>
The series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 10^10 = 10405071317.
Find the last ten digits of the series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 1000^1000.
